# Email_Spam_Chekker

In this I compare two supervised learning algorithms with some NLP techniques:
- Naive Bayes
- K Nearest Neighbors

After trained the model I check the accuracy of the paticular model on the email.csv dataset to check whether the email is spam or not spam.

## Result

Accuracy of the Naive Bayes Model seems damn good its approx 95%.<br>
After that I generate our own spam email and check the email in the model which shows the accurate result.

### Fork it and run the py file to check the results.
